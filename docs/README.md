# AlmaLinux Mirrors

Mirrors are extremely important to provide a fast and reliable infrastructure,
and we are very grateful to people and organizations that are helping us
with this.

This page contains a list of official [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/)
mirrors. If you want to set up a public mirror, please read
[our mirror guidelines](https://wiki.almalinux.org/Mirrors.html).
